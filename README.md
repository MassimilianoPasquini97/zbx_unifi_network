## How to use

First of all you need to import the template file ***zbx_template_unifi_network.yaml*** in Zabbix. üòÖ

Said that, this template use Unifi Network API so it need a view only local user on Unifi Network Web Interface.

Once you create view only user, on Zabbix create a new host and link ***Unifi Network*** template, those macros need to be configured:

- ***{$UNIFI.IP}***: IP or FQDN of Unifi Network Web Interface.
- ***{$UNIFI.USERNAME}***: Username of View Only user.
- ***{$UNIFI.PASSWORD}***: Password of View Only user.
- ***{$UNIFI.API.AUTH.URI}***: change to `api/login` if using unifi controller vm
- ***{$UNIFI.API.AUTH.TOKEN}***: change to `unifises` if using unifi controller vm
- ***{$UNIFI.API.URI}***: change to `api/s/default/stat` if using unifi controller vm

If you prefer you can modify other macros for further personalize trigger parameters.

If you done all right now it auto discover all Unifi Dream Machine, Unifi Switch and Unifi Access Point and create an host object for all of them.

### Monitoring multiple sites

By default, this template is configured for monitoring the `default` site. If you want to monitor a different site, swap `default` with the site ID from the `{$UNIFI.API.URI}` macro. To monitor multiple sites, create separate Zabbix hosts each with a distinct `{$UNIFI.API.URI}` macro value. Finding the site ID is straightforward, access your Unifi console in a browser, navigate to the site you want to monitor, and look for the site ID on the URL.
